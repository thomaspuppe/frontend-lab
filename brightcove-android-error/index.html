    <h1>Brightcove Android Error</h1>

    <i>VIDEOJS: ERROR: (CODE:4 MEDIA_ERR_SRC_NOT_SUPPORTED) The media could not be loaded, either because the server or network failed or because the format is not supported.</i>

    <iframe style="width:100%; max-width: 500px;" src='//players.brightcove.net/18140073001/H1kPIpR3_default/index.html?videoId=5088202182001&wmode=transparent&preload=none' allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen style="height:230px;width:410px;"></iframe>

    <p>This test case has no autostart and has advertising disabled (<a href="https://studio.brightcove.com/products/videocloud/players/players/H1kPIpR3">Brightcove Player</a>).</p>

    <p>You can also find it in production with autostart and ads: http://www.zeit.de/video/index (<a href="https://studio.brightcove.com/products/videocloud/players/players/65fa926a-0fe0-4031-8cbf-9db35cecf64a">Brightcove Player</a>). The first video (in doubt, search for the element '.video-stage-main') has this issue. On page load, there is a placeholder image. On click it gets replaced by an <a href="http://players.brightcove.net/18140073001/65fa926a-0fe0-4031-8cbf-9db35cecf64a_default/index.html?videoId=5088202182001">iframe</a>, which then has the error.

    <h2>We have tried multiple hypotheses</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Autostart on/off: makes no difference.</li>
        <li>For a while we thought the ads would trigger the error. But now we have disabled ads in the player, and still have the same error.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Some more information</h2>
    <ul>
    <li><b>IMPORTANT:</b> There are videos in our which do work on the same setup: <a href="old-video.html">old-video.html</a></li>
    <li>I have created a test case which uses the same player, but has ads: <a href="with-ads.html">with-ads.html</a></li>
    <li>Even when the error occurs, the network traffic shows that the m3u8 file and a working ts file get transmitted via the network. Which means, that the part "or because the format is not supported" of our error message might be the important one.</li>
    <li>Other Brightcove Customers with similar setup have <a href="http://app.handelsblatt.com/video/unternehmen/platooning-auf-deutschen-strassen-gefaehrlich-der-lkw-fahrer-wird-bald-zum-accessoire/14584626.html">working videos</a>.</li>

    </ul>
